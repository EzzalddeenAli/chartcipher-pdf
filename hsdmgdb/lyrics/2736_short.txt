Everybody says it'll be OK
But I don't know when that day will come
Will it come?
And all my friends they're trying to take me out, set me up
Get me a little drunk and have some fun


But the truth is I don't really care
Who these people are or what they have to say
And the truth is you're all I wanna see, when I get home tonight
And you're not there with me
Cause you're the only one who makes me, the only one who makes me happy


I've been sleeping too late with the curtains drawn, the lights ain't on
Damn this old heartbreak, I'll give anything
To be by your side and feel alive again, remember where we've been
At the river banks, throwing stones against the wind


Well the truth is I love you all the same
That night I broke your heart and the day you cursed my name
Yeah the truth is, I never really knew
You were everything to me, until it was much too late
Cause you're the only one who makes me, the only one who makes me happy


Well I threw it all away and I can't go back,
Yeah, I built these fires and left ashes in my path
And I know you'll never come 'round here no more
But what I'd give to have you back again
Oh, to have you back again


Yeah, the truth is you're all I wanna see
Yeah, the truth is I love you all the same
Yeah, well the truth is, I never really knew
You were everything to me, until it was much too late


Everybody says it'll be OK
But I don't know when that day will come
Will it come?
