It's the remix


I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya
Even though I know you love me, can't help it


I turn my cheek, music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting ready to face you
Can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous


'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody want to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody want to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous


Listen, I'm the type to never sweat no chick
Ain't nobody but you got me stressin' this way and you know
Yeah, yeah
Now the struggle's always real
Girls be stepping in my space
All up in your face, how am I supposed to feel?


I turn my chin, music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting ready to face you
Can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous


'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody want to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous


You're the only one invited
I said there's no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited (yeah)
When you get jealous too


I turn my chin, music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning ready to face you
Can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous


'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody want to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants to taste, that's why (that's why)
I still get jealous


Hey! (oh)
(That's why), (that's why)
I still get jealous
Jealous baby, jealous baby, baby! (Oh)
That's why (Nick J, Tinashe)
I still get jealous (jealous, jealous, jealous)
